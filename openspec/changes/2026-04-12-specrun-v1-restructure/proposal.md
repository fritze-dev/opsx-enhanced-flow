## Why

The current "OpenSpec/OPSX" naming and `openspec/` folder structure create unnecessary nesting, namespace confusion, and template duplication. The project is ready for a v1.0 release as **SpecShift** — a product name that stands on its own. A Fork & Rewrite approach duplicates the repo under the new name, restructures via `git mv`/`git rm`, and preserves the full git blame history. This matters because the prompts, SKILL.md, and specs have evolved through 58 changes — that reasoning is traceable via `git blame` and should not be lost.

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Rename product from "OpenSpec/OPSX" to "SpecShift", plugin name from `opsx` to `specshift`, skill name from `workflow` to `specshift` → commands become `specshift init`, `specshift propose`, `specshift apply`, `specshift finalize`
- **BREAKING**: Skill folder renamed from `src/skills/workflow/` to `src/skills/specshift/`
- **BREAKING**: New folder structure — `.specshift/` as hidden infrastructure dir, `docs/specs/` for flat specs
- **BREAKING**: Repository duplicated as `specshift` (old `opsx-enhanced-flow` archived). Full git history preserved via bare clone + remote change.
- All `openspec/` paths replaced via `git mv`: `openspec/WORKFLOW.md` → `.specshift/WORKFLOW.md`, `openspec/CONSTITUTION.md` → `.specshift/CONSTITUTION.md`, `openspec/specs/<name>/spec.md` → `docs/specs/<name>.md`, `openspec/changes/` → `.specshift/changes/`, `openspec/templates/` → `.specshift/templates/`
- Old changes (58) and ADRs (54) removed via `git rm` (recoverable from git history)
- Templates stay at `src/templates/` (plugin level), copied to `.specshift/templates/` during init
- Skill discovery via plugin system only — no `.agents/` or `.claude/skills/` symlinks
- `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` symlink replaced by single `CLAUDE.md`
- Dogfooding setup 1:1 like a client project (no symlinks)
- Template versions reset to 1, plugin version 1.0.0
- All "OpenSpec" wording removed from requirement names, spec text, templates, and docs

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

None — this is a structural refactoring, not a new feature.

### Modified Capabilities

All 14 existing specs receive path updates and naming changes:

- `artifact-pipeline`: `openspec/` paths → `.specshift/` and `docs/specs/` paths throughout
- `change-workspace`: Workspace path `openspec/changes/` → `.specshift/changes/`, proposal scan paths updated
- `constitution-management`: Constitution path `openspec/CONSTITUTION.md` → `.specshift/CONSTITUTION.md`
- `documentation`: All spec references, capability doc paths, ADR generation paths updated
- `human-approval-gate`: Review artifact path references updated
- `project-init`: Major rewrite — "Install OpenSpec Workflow" → "Install SpecShift", all target paths changed, legacy migration removed (handled by old repo README), template source paths updated, skill references `workflow` → `specshift`
- `quality-gates`: Spec reference paths updated
- `release-workflow`: Plugin name `opsx` → `specshift`, marketplace references updated, repo name changed
- `roadmap-tracking`: Minor path updates
- `spec-format`: Spec directory references updated
- `task-implementation`: Change artifact paths updated
- `test-generation`: Spec parsing paths updated
- `three-layer-architecture`: Architecture layer descriptions updated to reflect new structure
- `workflow-contract`: WORKFLOW.md path, template directory references updated

### Removed Capabilities

None.

### Consolidation Check

N/A — no new specs proposed. All 14 existing specs are modified for path/naming updates. No specs are merged or split — the capability boundaries remain unchanged.

## Impact

- **All 14 spec files**: Path references updated (~280+ occurrences)
- **SKILL.md**: Moved to `src/skills/specshift/SKILL.md`, all 39+ `openspec/` references updated, requirement anchor links updated
- **All 14 templates**: `openspec/` paths replaced with new paths
- **Plugin manifests**: Name and version changed
- **CONSTITUTION.md**: Self-referential paths and conventions updated
- **WORKFLOW.md**: templates_dir and context paths updated
- **README.md**: Complete rewrite for new product name and installation flow
- **docs/**: capabilities and README regenerated with new paths

## Scope & Boundaries

**In scope:**
- Duplicate repo as `specshift`, restructure via `git mv`/`git rm`
- All path and naming changes across specs, templates, skill, manifests
- Specs flattened via `git mv` (14 specs, `spec.md` → `<name>.md`)
- Old changes and ADRs removed via `git rm` (preserved in git history)
- New ADR-001 documenting the architecture decision
- New CHANGELOG.md starting at v1.0.0
- New README.md with SpecShift branding and install instructions
- Dogfooding setup as 1:1 client project

**Out of scope:**
- Scalable pipelines (fast/full) — deferred to future change
- Plugin update check hook — deferred to future change
- CI/CD enforcer GitHub Action — not needed (workflow handles guardrails)
- Anti-laziness directives — not needed (workflow handles this)
- Spec content changes beyond path/naming updates (behavior stays the same)
- Old repo migration tooling — migration prompt in archived repo README only
